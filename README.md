<h2>Introduction</h2>
<div>
  <p>I followed a tutorial from Sonny Songha on YouTube in order to continue the progression of my web development career.</p>
  <p>I found that this project was a good option / segway into mobile development through React Native. I had an interesting experience being able to utilize the Google Maps API in order to calculate the set distance between an origin and destination and then correspondingly using that data to present a estimated cost of travel to a user.</p>
</div>

<h2>Technological Stack</h2>
<div>
  <p>The project covers closely development in React Native + Redux for storing information in the data layer. We also utilize Tailwind CSS as a utility class for powering the stylesheets. In terms of the Google Maps API, we use the:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Directions API</b> for displaying formatted directions between a set of known locations.</li>
    <li><b>Places API</b> for retrieving autocomplete results to display related to the user search input.</li>
    <li><b>Distance Matrix API</b> for retrieving the travel distance and time for a matrix of origins and destinations. </li>
  </ul>
</div>
